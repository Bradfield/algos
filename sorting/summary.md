Summary
=======

-   A sequential search is $O(n)$ for ordered and unordered lists.
-   A binary search of an ordered list is $O(\log n)$ in the worst case.
-   Hash tables can provide constant time searching.
-   A bubble sort, a selection sort, and an insertion sort are
    $O(n^{2})$ algorithms.
-   A shell sort improves on the insertion sort by sorting
    incremental sublists. It falls between $O(n)$ and $O(n^{2})$.
-   A merge sort is $O(n \log n)$, but requires additional space for the
    merging process.
-   A quick sort is $O(n \log n)$, but may degrade to $O(n^{2})$ if the
    split points are not near the middle of the list. It does not
    require additional space.
