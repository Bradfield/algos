Programming Exercises
=====================

1.  Modify the depth first search function to produce a
    topological sort.
2.  Modify the depth first search to produce strongly
    connected components.
3.  Write the `transpose` method for the `Graph` class.
4.  Using breadth first search write an algorithm that can determine the
    shortest path from each vertex to every other vertex. This is called
    the all pairs shortest path problem.
5.  Using breadth first search revise the maze program from the
    recursion chapter to find the shortest path out of a maze.
6.  Write a program to solve the following problem: You have two jugs, a
    4-gallon and a 3-gallon. Neither of the jugs has markings on them.
    There is a pump that can be used to fill the jugs with water. How
    can you get exactly two gallons of water in the 4 gallon jug?
7.  Generalize the problem above so that the parameters to your solution
    include the sizes of each jug and the final amount of water to be
    left in the larger jug.
8.  Write a program that solves the following problem: Three
    missionaries and three cannibals come to a river and find a boat
    that holds two people. Everyone must get across the river to
    continue on the journey. However, if the cannibals ever outnumber
    the missionaries on either bank, the missionaries will be eaten.
    Find a series of crossings that will get everyone safely to the
    other side of the river.
