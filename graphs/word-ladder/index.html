      <p>To begin our study of graph algorithms let’s consider the following
puzzle called a word ladder. Transform the word “FOOL” into the word
“SAGE”. In a word ladder puzzle you must make the change occur gradually
by changing one letter at a time. At each step you must transform one
word into another word, you are not allowed to transform a word into a
non-word. The word ladder puzzle was invented in 1878 by Lewis Carroll,
the author of <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>. The following sequence of words
shows one possible solution to the problem posed above.</p>
<pre><code>FOOL
POOL
POLL
POLE
PALE
SALE
SAGE


</code></pre><p>There are many variations of the word ladder puzzle. For example you
might be given a particular number of steps in which to accomplish the
transformation, or you might need to use a particular word. In this
section we are interested in figuring out the smallest number of
transformations needed to turn the starting word into the ending word.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, since this chapter is on graphs, we can solve this
problem using a graph algorithm. Here is an outline of where we are
going:</p>
<ul>
<li>Represent the relationships between the words as a graph.</li>
<li>Use the graph algorithm known as breadth first search to find an
efficient path from the starting word to the ending word.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="building-the-word-ladder-graph">Building the Word Ladder Graph</h2>
<p>Our first problem is to figure out how to turn a large collection of
words into a graph. What we would like is to have an edge from one word
to another if the two words are only different by a single letter. If we
can create such a graph, then any path from one word to another is a
solution to the word ladder puzzle. The illustration below shows a
small graph of some words that solve the FOOL to SAGE word ladder
problem. Notice that the graph is an undirected graph and that the edges
are unweighted.</p>

  </figure></p>
<p>We could use several different approaches to create the graph we need to
solve this problem. Let’s start with the assumption that we have a list
of words that are all the same length. As a starting point, we can
create a vertex in the graph for every word in the list. To figure out
how to connect the words, we could compare each word in the list with
every other. When we compare we are looking to see how many letters are
different. If the two words in question are different by only one
letter, we can create an edge between them in the graph. For a small set
of words that approach would work fine; however let’s suppose we have a
list of 5,110 words. Roughly speaking, comparing one word to every other
word on the list is an <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>O</mi><mo>(</mo><msup><mi>n</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">O(n^2)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8141079999999999em;"></span><span class="strut bottom" style="height:1.064108em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="base textstyle uncramped"><span class="mord mathit" style="margin-right:0.02778em;">O</span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathit">n</span><span class="vlist"><span style="top:-0.363em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="fontsize-ensurer reset-size5 size5"><span style="font-size:0em;">​</span></span><span class="reset-textstyle scriptstyle uncramped"><span class="mord mathrm">2</span></span></span><span class="baseline-fix"><span class="fontsize-ensurer reset-size5 size5"><span style="font-size:0em;">​</span></span>​</span></span></span><span class="mclose">)</span></span></span></span> algorithm. For 5,110 words, <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>n</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">n^2</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8141079999999999em;"></span><span class="strut bottom" style="height:0.8141079999999999em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="base textstyle uncramped"><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathit">n</span><span class="vlist"><span style="top:-0.363em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="fontsize-ensurer reset-size5 size5"><span style="font-size:0em;">​</span></span><span class="reset-textstyle scriptstyle uncramped"><span class="mord mathrm">2</span></span></span><span class="baseline-fix"><span class="fontsize-ensurer reset-size5 size5"><span style="font-size:0em;">​</span></span>​</span></span></span></span></span></span> is
more than 26 million comparisons.</p>
<p>We can do much better by using the following approach. Suppose that we
have a huge number of buckets, each of them with a four-letter word on
the outside, except that one of the letters in the label has been
replaced by an underscore. For example we might have a bucket labeled
“pop_.” As we process each word in our list we compare the word with
each bucket, using the ‘_’ as a wildcard, so both “pope” and “pops”
would match “pop_.” Every time we find a matching bucket, we put our
word in that bucket. Once we have all the words in the appropriate
buckets we know that all the words in the bucket must be connected.</p>
<p>
  <figure>
    <img src="figures/word-buckets.png" alt="Word buckets for words that are different by one
letter">
    <figcaption>Word buckets for words that are different by one
letter</figcaption>
  </figure></p>
<p>In Python, we can implement the scheme we have just described by using a
dictionary. The labels on the buckets we have just described are the
keys in our dictionary. The value stored for that key is a list of
words. Once we have the dictionary built we can create the graph. We
start our graph by creating a vertex for each word in the graph. Then we
create edges between all the vertices we find for words found under the
same key in the dictionary.</p>
<p>Below is an example of Python code implementing this strategy. In this
case, we use a dictionary mapping vertices (words) to sets of the
vertices that can be reached by changing one letter in that word.</p>

<p>Since this is our first real-world graph problem, you might be wondering
how sparse is the graph? The <a href="vocabulary.txt">list of four-letter words</a>
we have for this problem is 5,110 words long. If we were to use an
adjacency matrix, the matrix would have 5,110 * 5,110 = 26,112,100 cells.
The graph constructed by the <code>build_graph</code> function has exactly 53,286
edges, so the matrix would have only 0.20% of the cells filled! That is
a very sparse matrix indeed.</p>
<h2 id="implementing-breadth-first-search">Implementing breadth first search</h2>
<p>With the graph constructed we can now turn our attention to the
algorithm we will use to find the shortest solution to the word ladder
problem. The graph algorithm we are going to use is called the “breadth
first search” algorithm. <strong>Breadth first search</strong> (<strong>BFS</strong>) is one of
the easiest algorithms for searching a graph. It also serves as a
prototype for several other important graph algorithms that we will
study later.</p>
<p>Given a graph <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>G</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">G</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68333em;"></span><span class="strut bottom" style="height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="base textstyle uncramped"><span class="mord mathit">G</span></span></span></span> and a starting vertex <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>s</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">s</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="strut" style="height:0.43056em;"></span><span class="strut bottom" style="height:0.43056em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="base textstyle uncramped"><span class="mord mathit">s</span></span></span></span>, a breadth first search
proceeds by exploring edges in the graph to find all the vertices in <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>G</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">G</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68333em;"></span><span class="strut bottom" style="height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="base textstyle uncramped"><span class="mord mathit">G</span></span></span></span>

The remarkable thing about a breadth
first search is that it finds <em>all</em> the vertices that are a distance <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>k</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">k</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="strut" style="height:0.69444em;"></span><span class="strut bottom" style="height:0.69444em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="base textstyle uncramped"><span class="mord mathit" style="margin-right:0.03148em;">k</span></span></span></span>

One
good way to visualize what the breadth first search algorithm does is to
imagine that it is building a tree, one level of the tree at a time. A
breadth first search adds all children of the starting vertex before it
begins to discover any of the grandchildren.</p>
<p>The breadth first search algorithm shown below uses the adjacency
list graph representation we developed earlier. In addition it uses a
queue at a crucial point as we will see, to decide which vertex to explore
next, and also to maintain a record of the depth to which we have
traversed at any point.</p>
<p>BFS starts by initializing a set to retain a record of which vertices
have been visited already. Next, we initialize a queue (in this case
utilizing the deque type from Python’s <code>collections</code> module) which will
contain all paths from our starting vertex that we have explored as our
algorithm progress. As such we initialize it with a list containing just
our starting vertex.</p>
<p>The next step is to begin to systematically grow the paths one at a
time, starting from the path at the front of the queue, in each case
taking one more step from the vertex last explored.</p>
<p>Once we have popped from our queue a path to continue exploring and
retrieved the last the vertex visited from that path, we retrieve its
neighbors from our graph, remove those vertices that we know have
already been visited, then for each of the remaining (unvisited)
neighbors do two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add the vertex to <code>visited</code></li>
<li>Add a path consisisting of the path so far plus the vertex</li>
</ol>
<p>Adding the new vertex effectively schedules it for
further exploration, but not until all the other vertices on the
adjacency list have been explored.</p>

<p>Let’s look at how the <code>traverse</code> function would construct the breadth first
tree corresponding to the word ladder graph we considered previously.
Starting from fool we take all nodes that are adjacent to fool and add
them to the tree. The adjacent nodes include pool, foil, foul, and cool.
Each of these nodes are added to the queue of new nodes to expand.
The illustration below shows the state of the in-progress tree along
with the queue after this step.</p>
<p>
  <figure>
    <img src="figures/bfs-1.png" alt="The first step in the breadth first search">
    <figcaption>The first step in the breadth first search</figcaption>
  </figure></p>
<p>In the next step <code>traverse</code> removes the next node (pool) from the front
of the queue and repeats the process for all of its adjacent nodes.
However, when <code>traverse</code> examines the node cool, it finds that it has
already been visited. This implies that there is a shorter path to cool.
The only new node added to the queue while examining pool is poll. The
new state of the tree and queue is shown below.</p>
<p>
  <figure>
    <img src="figures/bfs-2.png" alt="The second step in the breadth first search">
    <figcaption>The second step in the breadth first search</figcaption>
  </figure></p>
<p>The next vertex on the queue is foil. The only new node that foil can
add to the tree is fail. As <code>traverse</code> continues to process the queue,
neither of the next two nodes add anything new to the queue or the tree.
The illustration below shows the tree and the queue after expanding
all the vertices on the second level of the tree.</p>

<p>You should continue to work through the algorithm on your own so that
you are comfortable with how it works. The illustration below shows the
final breadth first search tree after all the vertices have been
expanded.</p>

<h2 id="breadth-first-search-analysis">Breadth First Search Analysis</h2>
<p>Before we continue with other graph algorithms let us analyze the run
time performance of the breadth first search algorithm. The first thing
to observe is that the while loop is executed, at most, one time for
each vertex in the graph <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><mi>V</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">|V|</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="strut" style="height:0.75em;"></span><span class="strut bottom" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="base textstyle uncramped"><span class="mord mathrm">∣</span><span class="mord mathit" style="margin-right:0.22222em;">V</span><span class="mord mathrm">∣</span></span></span></span>. You can see that this is true because a
vertex must be white before it can be examined and added to the queue.
This gives us <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>O</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>V</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">O(V)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="strut" style="height:0.75em;"></span><span class="strut bottom" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="base textstyle uncramped"><span class="mord mathit" style="margin-right:0.02778em;">O</span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord mathit" style="margin-right:0.22222em;">V</span><span class="mclose">)</span></span></span></span> for the while loop. The for loop, which is nested
inside the while is executed at most once for each edge in the graph,

The reason is that every vertex is dequeued at most once and we
examine an edge from node <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>u</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">u</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="strut" style="height:0.43056em;"></span><span class="strut bottom" style="height:0.43056em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="base textstyle uncramped"><span class="mord mathit">u</span></span></span></span> to node <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="strut" style="height:0.43056em;"></span><span class="strut bottom" style="height:0.43056em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="base textstyle uncramped"><span class="mord mathit" style="margin-right:0.03588em;">v</span></span></span></span> only when node <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>u</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">u</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="strut" style="height:0.43056em;"></span><span class="strut bottom" style="height:0.43056em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="base textstyle uncramped"><span class="mord mathit">u</span></span></span></span> is
dequeued.

gives us <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>O</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>V</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>E</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">O(V + E)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="strut" style="height:0.75em;"></span><span class="strut bottom" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="base textstyle uncramped"><span class="mord mathit" style="margin-right:0.02778em;">O</span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord mathit" style="margin-right:0.22222em;">V</span><span class="mbin">+</span><span class="mord mathit" style="margin-right:0.05764em;">E</span><span class="mclose">)</span></span></span></span>.</p>
<p>Of course doing the breadth first search is only part of the task.
Following the links from the starting node to the goal node is the other
part of the task. The worst case for this would be if the graph was a
single long chain. In this case traversing through all of the vertices
would be <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>O</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>V</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">O(V)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="strut" style="height:0.75em;"></span><span class="strut bottom" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="base textstyle uncramped"><span class="mord mathit" style="margin-right:0.02778em;">O</span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord mathit" style="margin-right:0.22222em;">V</span><span class="mclose">)</span></span></span></span>. The normal case is going to be some fraction of <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><mi>V</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">|V|</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="strut" style="height:0.75em;"></span><span class="strut bottom" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="base textstyle uncramped"><span class="mord mathrm">∣</span><span class="mord mathit" style="margin-right:0.22222em;">V</span><span class="mord mathrm">∣</span></span></span></span>
but we would still write <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>O</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>V</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">O(V)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="strut" style="height:0.75em;"></span><span class="strut bottom" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="base textstyle uncramped"><span class="mord mathit" style="margin-right:0.02778em;">O</span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord mathit" style="margin-right:0.22222em;">V</span><span class="mclose">)</span></span></span></span>.</p>
<p>Finally, at least for this problem, there is the time required to build
the initial graph. We leave the analysis of the <code>build_graph</code> function as
an exercise for you.</p>
