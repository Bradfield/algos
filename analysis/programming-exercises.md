Programming Exercises
=====================

1.  Devise an experiment to verify that the list index operator is
    $O(1)$
2.  Devise an experiment to verify that get item and set item are $O(1)$
    for dictionaries.
3.  Devise an experiment that compares the performance of the `del`
    operator on lists and dictionaries.
4.  Given a list of numbers in random order, write an algorithm that
    works in $O(n\log(n))$ to find the kth smallest number in the list.
5.  Can you improve the algorithm from the previous problem to be
    linear? Explain.
