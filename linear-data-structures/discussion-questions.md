Discussion Questions
====================

1.  Convert the following values to binary using “divide by 2.” Show the
    stack of remainders.
    -   17
    -   45
    -   96

2.  Convert the following infix expressions to prefix (use full
    parentheses):
    -   (A+B)\*(C+D)\*(E+F)
    -   A+((B+C)\*(D+E))
    -   A\*B\*C\*D+E+F

3.  Convert the above infix expressions to postfix (use
    full parentheses).
4.  Convert the above infix expressions to postfix using the direct
    conversion algorithm. Show the stack as the conversion takes place.
5.  Evaluate the following postfix expressions. Show the stack as each
    operand and operator is processed.
    -   2 3 \* 4 +
    -   1 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 +
    -   1 2 3 4 5 \* + \* +

6.  The alternative implementation of the `Queue` ADT is to use a list
    such that the rear of the queue is at the end of the list. What
    would this mean for Big-O performance?
7.  What is the result of carrying out both steps of the linked list
    `add` method in reverse order? What kind of reference results? What
    types of problems may result?
8.  Explain how the linked list `remove` method works when the item to
    be removed is in the last node.
9.  Explain how the `remove` method works when the item is in the *only*
    node in the linked list.
